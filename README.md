# Bullet-Lines
A simple script for grabbing clipboard text and adding new lines at bullet points. 

Prerequisites: 
- Keyboard Maestro is used to simulate the Cmd+C and Cmd+V keystrokes. 

To install: 
- cd into the folder that bullet.py is in 
- Type "chmod +x bullet.sh" into Terminal to make the shell script executable. 

To use: 
- Copy the text you want to the clipboard (highlight --> Cmd+C) as usual. 
- Run this script. 
- The newly formatted text is now on your clipboard! Paste as you like (or, in my case, use Keyboard Maestro to paste).
