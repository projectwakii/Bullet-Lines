# Bullet-Lines
A simple script for grabbing clipboard text and adding new lines at bullet points. 

To use: 
- Copy the text you want to the clipboard (highlight --> Cmd+C) as usual. 
- Run this script. 
- The newly formatted text is now on your clipboard! 

I used Keyboard Maestro (a separate Mac app) to do copy/paste keyboard events since
that is a little trickier.
